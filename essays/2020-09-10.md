## No Such Thing As A Stupid Question?

I remember in class the teacher would utter the phrase: "There are no stupid questions." This was in an effort to encourage us students to ask for help without feeling ashamed for not knowing something. There is no shame in asking for help when you need it. There is no shame in admitting you do not know or understand something. However, there is such thing as a stupid question.

## Did You Even Try Googling it?
I remember a conversation I had with my uncle on this very topic. He agrees that there is such thing as a stupid question. His definition of a stupid question is a question that is lazy and low in effort. According to my uncle, people ask stupid questions when they are too lazy to find an answer for themselves. If you ask a question that simply requires a quick and easy Google search to answer, then you are asking a stupid question. In the digital age where Google is always readily availible, there is no reason to ask such low effort questions. Before you ask, ask Google. Odds are that someone has asked the same question before.

## Still Stuck?
So you put in some time searching for an answer but still no luck. You looked on various sources and forums but still cant find the answer or help you are looking for. Now what? Well now is the time to actually ask your question. However, good answers require good questions. A simple "Help! Not Working!" will not cut it. A detailed guide to asking smart questions for programmers can be foung in Eric Raymond's essay <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">here</a>. To summarize Raymond's guide, make sure your question is: clear, consise, formal, and explicit. Also don't only ask for the answer to your homework because according to Raymond, that makes you a loser.
