## &lt;h2&gt;This Is HTML&lt;&#47;h2&gt;
I have to admit something. Using HTML is still something that is still quite new to me. I've used HTML in the past but never really understood what I was doing. My first experience with HTML was to prank my friends by faking a website's text. I understood HTML enough to edit a website's text using "Inspect Element" but thats about it. Everytime I used HTML I felt like I was reverse engineering lines of code. I literally had to look up how to do every single thing in HTML like adding headers, images, and elements. I never had any sense of fluency in the language until recently. About two weeks ago I took the time to study the ins and outs of HTML. So far, I find HTML to be quite easy to learn and understand. Learning HTML and CSS took less than a few hours to get the hang of.
## Coding With Style
Being able to code is not enough. You not only have to know how to code, you have to know how to code with style! That is where CSS comes in. HTML and CSS go together like peanut butter and jelly! Like HTML, CSS was also quite easy to learn. CSS allowed me to take my HTML code and add some flavor. No more black black text on a white background. Now I could format my site and determine the color, size, spacing, and positioning of various elements. However Using pure HTML and CSS proved to be a pain when creating a sleek modern website. Using pure HTML and CSS made my websites look like the came straight out of 1999. Thats where learning UI Frameworks come in.
