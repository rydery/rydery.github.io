The semester has finally come to and end. I did it...hopefully. I have finished a semester of ICS 314! I have learned a lot in this class when it comes to application development. I even created my first web application for my final project. But besides general coding knowlege, I also learned much more as an ICS 314 student.

## Sturcture is Key
Working on the group project especially at home served as a valuble lesson for project management. Having a well structured plan is important when it comes to tackling any sort of problem not just application development.

## Stick to Standards
Not sticking to a coding standard is like having a messy room. If there is no structure for where you put things in your room, you will probabaly spend a lot of time looking for lost objects. I myself am constantly looking for my keys and wallet all the time in my room. Using ESlint as a coding standard has taught me the importance of sticking to a set of rules. While it can be a hassel to keep things like your room neat and orderly, it becomes worth it when you no longer need to franticly look for you keys so you are not late for work. The same goes for programming. Keeping everything neat and organized from the start saves you a lot of hassel down the road. You'll spend less time wondering where things are if everything is in order. Programmers are constantly troubleshooting lines of code and coding standard make finding errors much easier and prevent them from even happening.
