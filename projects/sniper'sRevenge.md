This program is an expansion of my first Java program "Dodgeball". While the overall objective of dodging items on-screen remains the same, there is an extra layer of difficulty.
In addition to dodging elements on-screen, you have two depleting health bars. Certain elements on screen must be collected in order to refill your health bars and stay alive.

Like my previous project "Dodgeball", I really enjoyed creating this program. This project really tested my understanding of conditional statements and loops. I spent a lot of time fixing bugs in this game. Some unintended bugs include: Health bars were not updating properly, game-ending events were not triggering, hitboxes were not registering, and game elements were not appearing or moving as intended. The majority of these bugs were a result of improper conditions in my conditional statements. Another improvement from my initial "Dodgeball" program is the addition of a starting loading screen and a "You lose" screen. The theme for this game is heavily based on internet video game culture.
