[Study Dojo](https://study-dojo.github.io/) is a website that enables students to help learn from and teach their peers. Students can register as “sensei” for classes they willing to attempt to help and “grasshopper” for classes they are currently enrolled in. For each course they are registered as grasshopper, students can propose study sessions around a topic and a time. This notifies all grasshoppers and sensei for that course, allowing them to respond if they intend to attend the study session.

This project allowed me to practice coding in my very first programming language: Java. It also gave me lots of practice using the Eclipse program. I really enjoyed this project as it is the first ever game I created. I spent a lot of time on the creative aspect of the game. I added custom images and sounds in order to make the game as silly as possible. However in doing so, I learned a lot about Java. For example, the character model having an iregular shape resulted in some hit detection issues. Sometimes a hit would register when there was no collision visually due to the hit-box being a basic rectangle larger than the actual character model. To reslove this issue a custom hit-box was created.
